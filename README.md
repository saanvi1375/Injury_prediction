# Injury_prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting sports injuries, particularly in American Football. By analyzing various factors such as player movements, game conditions, and environmental factors, our models aim to identify injury risk factors and estimate recovery time in case of injury.

## Getting Started

To get started, download the datasets InjuryRecord.csv and PlayList.csv from [here](https://github.com/tkding/COGS108_fa22-final-project-data-file/blob/main/InjuryRecord%20.csv)

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saanvi1375/Injury_prediction.git
```

## Usage

Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. Then, run all the cells in the provided Jupyter Notebook (injury_prediction.ipynb). Make sure to change the dataset path wherever required.
